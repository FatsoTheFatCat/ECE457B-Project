## Repository
This ECE457B-Project repository is for our ECE 457B course project code that is to identify traffic lights and determine the state of the light. We are using MATLAB, Python, or a combination of the two as the language(s) for the code. 

### Getting Started with Git for Noobs
- To get started with this repo, clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/FatsoTheFatCat/fydp.git`.
- Create a new development branch: `git branch -b "name-of-new-branch"`.
	- You may need to set up the reference between your local branch and the remote branch: `git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git`
- At any point in time, if you want to check which files have been modified: `git status`
	- You can see the changes for a specific file with: `git diff name-of-file`
		- To exit the diff, click `q` then ENTER
- When you're ready to save, 
	- Add all of the files that you've made changes: `git add name-of-file` for *each* file
	- And commit them with a meaningful message: `git commit -m "message"`
- To sync your local changes to this remote repo: `git push`
